  <p class = "lead"><small>Research on Artificial intelligence based techniques for Smart Grid power management and power demand balance. 
    I deeply value interdisciplinary collaboration, and welcome you to <a class = "active" href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you are interested. 
    You can find detailed information about my publications, software, and other work on <a class="active" href="cv.html">my CV</a>.</small></p>

<h4 style="margin-top:0">Power management in Smart Grids</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  <br/><br/>
  I researched on household level power consumption forecasting and demand response management using smart metre data.
  The code is available <a href = "https://github.com/ritukajaiswal/Anomaly-Detection-Code-and-Anomaly-Labelled-Dataset-on-Ausgrid-Data">here</a> and

<h4>Optimal Design of Wind Farm collector system</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I also researched on best integration of Wind farms to the Smart Grid neighborhoods so that power is available even after connection to the main Grid is cut off.
  The paper is published here <a href = "https://ojs.bibsys.no/index.php/NIK/article/view/927">here</a>.
