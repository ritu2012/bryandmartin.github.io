<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Teaching</h1>
<p class = "lead"><small>I had the opportunity to co-supervise 3 master students for their dissertations with my PhD supervisor as their main supervisor. 
I am passionate about data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and Graph Theory for solving challenging problems in different domains. 
I taught them machine learning techniques they used in their research. 

Inside and outside of my teaching, I actively try to leverage my position to advocate for and work towards building more equitable communities and cultures within Computer Science, as well as STEM and academia more broadly, at all levels.
I always welcome discussion on any of these topics, so please feel free to  <a class = "active" href="contact.html">reach out</a> if you are interested. 
You can find detailed information about my teaching experience on <a class="active" href="cv.html">my CV</a>.</small></p>
